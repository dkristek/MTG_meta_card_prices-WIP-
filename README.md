# MTG_meta_card_prices
### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze how often specific Magic: The Gathering cards are used in tournaments. Currently this repository contains code only for the webscraping of the data with plans to load the data into a SQL database and create a visualization dashboard.

All tournament results were scraped from MTGgoldfish.com

### Background
Magic: The Gathering is the most popular and most played Trading Card Game (TCG) in the world. Thousands of people play Magic competitively at various tournaments around the world and online. In Magic, players build a deck of 60 cards with no more than 4 duplicates of any given card (with some exceptions). Magic cards are only available in randomized packs so there is a large secondary market where players buy and sell cards obtained from these randomized packs. The aim of this project is to visualize the price change of a card as its appearances in tournaments changes.

There are many different formats for competitive Magic: The Gathering. A 'format' is the ruleset that determines what cards are legal to use in the competition. One of the most popular formats for competitive Magic: The Gather is called 'Modern'. In the Modern format all Magic cards released since 2003 (barring some products not meant for competitive play), this large swath of legal cards is a main factor in Modern's popularity. It is also why I chose to focus this project on Modern format, as I believed the range of availibility and age of the cards in the format would provide more interesting data than focusing on a format that uses only more recent cards. So for this project all tournament results were for the 'Modern Format'.
